        <h1>CSS Positioning</h1>

        <p>The <code>position</code> property is a layout technique that can let us change where and how elements appear on a page. More specifically, it allows us to arrange an element relative to:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>its current position within the <strong>document flow</strong>;</li>
            <li>its <strong>containing</strong> element; or</li>
            <li>the browser <strong>viewport</strong>.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>There are five different position values and four offset properties to go along with them. Today, we'll cover three of these position values.</p>

        <div class="gallery">
            <div>
                <img src="img/camera.webp" alt="">
            </div>
            <div>
                <img src="img/charcuterie.webp" alt="">
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Position Property Values</h2>

        <h3>Static Positioning</h3>

        <p><strong>Static</strong> is the default for all HTML elements. If an element is set to static, then it will follow the <strong>regular document flow</strong>.</p>

        <p>A static element cannot be nudged around by offset properties. However, it is helpful if you have an element that has another type of positioning in a mobile or smaller view and you want to return it to where it belongs in a desktop or larger view (using a rule in a media query).</p>

        <h3>Relative Positioning</h3>

        <p>Other than static, <strong>relative</strong> is the only position value that keeps the element in the normal document flow - that is, it still occupies its original space in the document.</p>

        <p>Although something relatively positioned will respond to offset properties, relatively positioned elements are usually used as <strong>containers</strong>, or boundaries for positioning other things within it.</p>

        <h3>Absolute Positioning</h3>

        <p><strong>Absolute</strong> positioning removes an element from the normal document flow. This means that the space it once occupied will <strong>collapse</strong>. If you want to create space for it, you will need to define the height and width of a container.</p>

        <p>Absolute positioning also positions an element relative to the <strong>nearest positioned ancestor</strong> (an ancestor element with a position other than static). This is why we usually put an absolutely positioned element inside of a <strong>relatively positioned container</strong>.</p>

        <p>If no such ancestor exists, it will be positioned relative to the initial containing block, usually the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element or the viewport.</p>

        <p>Absolute positioning is useful for precise placement of elements, such as tooltips, pop-ups, or elements that need to be placed in a specific location on the page. However, it should be used sparingly, as it disrupts regular document flow.</p>

        <h2>Offset Properties</h2>

        <p><strong>Offset</strong> properties help precisely place a non-static element, relative to its reference point. There are four offset properties in total.</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Top</strong>: Moves the element down from the top of its reference point.</li>
            <li><strong>Right</strong>: Moves the element left from the right edge of its reference point.</li>
            <li><strong>Bottom</strong>: Moves the element up from the bottom of its reference point.</li>
            <li><strong>Left</strong>: Moves the element right from the left edge of its reference point.</li>
        </ol>
